Here is where you would put the text for Chapter 1. 

# Here is A First-Level Header

This is the way you cite something, like my blog post [@reeveDissertation2022]. 

Here is a footnote reference.[^1] 

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

You can also make footnotes, like this.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]

[See the Pandoc documentation for more on footnotes.](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#footnotes)

## Images 

You can also include images, like this: 

![A picture of a kitten](images/kitten.jpg)

Or make them figures. See [@fig:kitten] for an example of one. 

![A picture of a kitten](images/kitten2.jpg){#fig:kitten}

## And Math

Here is some inline math: $\pi^2$ 

And here is an equation: 

$$\frac{\pi \times \sum{5}{X}}{2a}$${#eq:fakeEquation}

See [@eq:fakeEquation] for the equation.
